00:00:21.552 --> 00:00:23.320
You're about to hold a plank.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.222
Just 60 seconds.

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:26.790
You know it’s coming.

00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:28.792
That tension in your core.

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:30.327
The burn in your arms.

00:00:30.527 --> 00:00:32.396
The mental countdown ticking away.

00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:34.231
You’re already thinking,

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.438
Now imagine you push through that feeling.

00:00:41.672 --> 00:00:42.706
You hold on. 

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:44.508
Maybe your body starts shaking.

00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:47.010
Your mind is screaming for you to stop.

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:50.347
You tell yourself just one more second, 

00:00:50.714 --> 00:00:52.249
and you make it to 60.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.185
You’re feeling pretty proud of yourself.

00:00:56.887 --> 00:00:59.289
(Cheers and applause)

00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:06.930
But then you don’t stop at 60 seconds.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.465
You don't stop at five minutes.

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:10.834
You keep going for an hour,

00:01:11.268 --> 00:01:16.139
for two hours and then ten hours.

00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:21.278
Yep, ten hours, ten minutes, 
and ten seconds.

00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:24.348
That's exactly what George Hood did

00:01:24.348 --> 00:01:28.986
when he set the world record
for the longest plank in history,

00:01:30.387 --> 00:01:33.323
a feat that most people
would not believe possible.

00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:38.929
I met George eight years ago
when he set the record,

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.731
at that time, five hours.

00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:42.199
And I’ll tell you this,

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.170
he just looked like the definition
of mental toughness.

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:52.843
The focus in his eyes was razor sharp
 and he was drenched in sweat.

00:01:53.043 --> 00:01:54.678
He was hurting.

00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:56.313
You could see it in his face.

00:01:56.747 --> 00:02:00.784
Feel it in his body, but he didn’t stop.

00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:05.722
Later I asked him,
George, how do you do it?

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.558
His answer surprised me.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.194
The plank is 90% mental.

00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:14.498
George told me 
he kept his mind busy

00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:19.069
distracting himself by focusing on 
the conversations in the room,

00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:22.139
drawing energy 
from the people around him.

00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:25.709
But there was something
deeper happening here.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.047
We often think of grit
as that mental toughness

00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:33.383
that helps people achieve
extraordinary things,

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:36.920
like ultramarathoners finishing
races with broken bones.

00:02:37.487 --> 00:02:39.056
But here's the twist.

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:42.159
Grit isn't just about willpower.

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:49.599
It’s rooted in biology, and the most
powerful indicator to date is a protein

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:52.069
 that we’re just starting to understand,

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:57.307
called Brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, or BDNF.

00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:02.579
Think of BDNF as
fertilizer for your brain.

00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:06.650
A protein that helps neurons, 
the cells in your brain,

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:11.388
grow, stay healthy, and 
communicate more effectively.

00:03:11.788 --> 00:03:17.527
This protein is crucial for things
like memory and mental resilience.

00:03:18.128 --> 00:03:20.530
Many things increase BDNF, 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.035
including sunshine, blueberries,
and antidepressants.

00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:29.206
Exercise increases BDNF the most.

00:03:30.107 --> 00:03:33.477
And the plank?
Yes, that simple yoga pose,

00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.614
just might be one of the best exercises

00:03:37.614 --> 00:03:40.150
for building mental toughness.

00:03:40.984 --> 00:03:43.587
I’m a clinical professor and diplomat

00:03:43.587 --> 00:03:46.623
in the Department of
Preventive Medicine at UCSD. 

00:03:47.424 --> 00:03:51.328
I’ve been doing clinical research
for over 40 years.

00:03:52.462 --> 00:03:55.565
In the clinic, 
many of the patients I care for

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:58.635
 are so-called medically destitute.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.405
Some had a heart attack
or stroke in their 40s.

00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:06.643
Some experienced 
a horrific accident in their 20s,

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.479
rendering them unemployable,

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.416
stripping them of everything
 and leaving them with chronic pain

00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:17.320
or disability and 
a heavy dose of despair.

00:04:18.622 --> 00:04:24.828
In no way am I suggesting something as
basic as a plank can fix these conditions.

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:31.001
But more research is warranted
to learn the potential benefits.

00:04:32.636 --> 00:04:36.540
What makes the concept of grit
 and BDNF so compelling to me

00:04:36.907 --> 00:04:42.712
are real life examples of individuals 
enduring these devastating conditions.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.618
Researchers and clinicians still have a
lot of questions about grit and the plank.

00:04:49.352 --> 00:04:53.323
No one has ever studied
BDNF during a plank.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.661
Yet, what we know is this: 

00:04:57.661 --> 00:05:01.765
the most effective exercises
for raising BDNF levels 

00:05:01.765 --> 00:05:04.968
are those requiring mental effort.

00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:10.273
If you've ever done a plank, you know
how quickly mental fortitude is required.

00:05:10.974 --> 00:05:13.944
That, along with what
we've learned from George,

00:05:13.944 --> 00:05:18.081
leads us to believe the plank
may be one of the most efficient

00:05:18.415 --> 00:05:22.252
and effective ways of increasing BDNF.

00:05:23.153 --> 00:05:27.123
You see, grit is not just for planks.

00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:31.127
And BDNF is not just a theory,

00:05:31.428 --> 00:05:33.630
it’s backed by science.

00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:40.136
A 2005 article in the aptly 
named journal Hippocampus

00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:45.075
described an animal study
in which exhausting physical exercises

00:05:45.075 --> 00:05:48.678
like continuous swimming
 produce less BDNF

00:05:49.045 --> 00:05:54.050
than exercise that required
 mental focus, like navigating mazes.

00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:59.456
In people, activities 
such as yoga, of all things

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.327
that combine physical effort 
and concentration,

00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:10.066
have produced some of the highest levels
of BDNF ever measured.

00:06:11.534 --> 00:06:15.705
Currently, I’m designing 
a study for people like Daniel

00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:19.209
to see if the plank relieves pain.

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:22.612
Daniel suffers from 
a very rare condition

00:06:23.146 --> 00:06:29.853
known as Complex regional
pain syndrome, or CRPS,

00:06:30.487 --> 00:06:34.958
which is infamous as
one of the most painful diseases.

00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:37.594
There is no known cure.

00:06:38.395 --> 00:06:42.999
As one patient said,
the slight sensation of water dripping

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:45.969
on my foot feels like hot lead.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.373
Despite living with 
this excruciating pain,

00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:56.212
Daniel managed to do 
a plank for over nine hours

00:06:57.747 --> 00:07:00.216
 on his CRPS arm.

00:07:00.917 --> 00:07:02.519
Think about that for a minute.

00:07:03.753 --> 00:07:08.892
The most physically and mentally
challenging exercises helped

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:11.795
one of the most painful conditions.

00:07:13.063 --> 00:07:19.970
Now we have evidence that an important 
part of the answer lies in BDNF.

00:07:21.004 --> 00:07:25.041
In August of 2024, an article appeared

00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:28.445
in Experimental Neurobiology titled

00:07:28.645 --> 00:07:32.949
“Modulation of BDNF 
by Physical Exercise.”

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.588
They found exercise
doubled the level of BDNF.

00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:43.860
I am here to raise awareness 

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:47.931
so that this relationship 
between exercise, BDNF

00:07:48.298 --> 00:07:52.435
and improving the quality of life 
may be studied further.

00:07:53.336 --> 00:07:56.740
BDNF is hot in the research world.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.142
I'm about to make it hotter.

00:07:59.509 --> 00:08:02.112
(Cheers and applause)

00:08:06.316 --> 00:08:11.121
George, Daniel and 
my patients deserve as much.

00:08:11.988 --> 00:08:15.458
Now I'm going to leave you
with the challenge.

00:08:15.658 --> 00:08:20.196
The next time you feel you need
 more grit in your life, do a plank.

00:08:20.964 --> 00:08:24.167
If you can't get on the floor,
do it against a wall.

00:08:24.534 --> 00:08:28.471
It only takes a minute, 
but that minute can be transformative.

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:31.941
Thank you. (Applause)
