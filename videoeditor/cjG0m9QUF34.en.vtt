Manoush Zomorodi: OK, so I have
been following Jasmine's career.

00:00:06.637 --> 00:00:10.007
She gave a TED Talk at TEDWomen
five years ago --

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:12.443
Jasmine Crowe-Houston:
Five years ago in December.

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:13.611
MZ: Which is crazy.

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:17.748
And I interviewed you three years ago,
and now here you are.

00:00:17.748 --> 00:00:20.017
And so much has happened.

00:00:20.017 --> 00:00:21.218
JCH: Yes.

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:23.487
MZ: You are more of
a behind-the-scenes person.

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:25.423
For people who don't know Goodr,

00:00:25.456 --> 00:00:30.061
explain your story, how you came
to be so aware of food waste

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:31.629
and what you are doing about it.

00:00:31.662 --> 00:00:32.830
JCH: Hi, everyone.

00:00:32.863 --> 00:00:34.532
I'm so excited to be back at TED.

00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:36.634
This is like, we have a relationship here.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:40.337
I mean, TEDx, TEDWomen,
TED Radio, TEDNext.

00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:43.374
I mean, I'm going to name my next kid Ted.

00:00:43.407 --> 00:00:45.676
(Laughter)

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:48.612
But, you know, I started
Goodr here in Atlanta.

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:52.116
I had created a homeless --

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.220
I would say, for people experiencing
homelessness, a pop-up restaurant.

00:00:56.253 --> 00:00:58.689
And the concept really came to me

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:01.725
after feeding and working
with a volunteer group

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.395
and making all these
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:06.597
going out to the streets
and handing them out,

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.933
and a man telling me,
"Oh, I'm allergic to nuts."

00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:12.403
And I thought, we just made 1,000
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,

00:01:12.403 --> 00:01:14.672
and nuts are one
of the number one allergies.

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:17.575
And it made me think that dignity was lost

00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:19.410
in how we are serving our unhoused,

00:01:19.443 --> 00:01:21.312
in how we're serving people in need.

00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:22.713
And that too often we think,

00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:24.715
well, they're homeless or they're hungry,

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:25.916
take this and be happy,

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.886
forgetting the fact that they
could have religious convictions,

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:31.722
dietary restrictions,
or they could plain out be allergic.

00:01:31.755 --> 00:01:35.326
And so I created this pop-up restaurant
where I would rent tables and chairs

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.361
and linens and print out menus

00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:40.131
and let people feel like
they were dining at a restaurant.

00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:42.967
And a video went viral,
and it was a 15-second clip.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.637
I'll never forget it, because it was
before Instagram allowed you to have,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.539
you know, minute-videos, longer videos.

00:01:48.572 --> 00:01:51.709
So I woke up one morning
really afraid because I had never,

00:01:51.742 --> 00:01:53.110
I mean obviously gone viral.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.446
And I was like,
what's going on on Facebook?

00:01:55.446 --> 00:01:56.780
I need to get off this app.

00:01:56.814 --> 00:01:58.349
It was like one of those things.

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.886
And so I'm reading through millions
of views and comments,

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:05.189
and what people kept asking me
was: Who donated the food?

00:02:05.222 --> 00:02:08.359
And the truth was, nobody,
I was couponing, price-matching.

00:02:08.392 --> 00:02:10.628
I would start cooking on Friday, Saturday,

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:13.931
go out and feed about 300-500
people every Sunday.

00:02:13.964 --> 00:02:16.400
And so I was like, I need
to get this food donated.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.703
I went to Google, fully expecting
to get a list of all the businesses

00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:21.405
that are going to donate food to me

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:22.940
to help me keep feeding people.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.476
And I would, you know,
live happily ever after.

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.445
And instead I found about food waste.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.616
And I read an 86-page report
by the Harvard Food Law Policy Group.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.218
And as I'm reading through this,

00:02:34.218 --> 00:02:36.687
at this point now into
the wee hours of the morning,

00:02:36.687 --> 00:02:38.689
I'm getting upset because I'm thinking

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.092
about the people
that are lined up at 9am

00:02:42.092 --> 00:02:44.929
for my 3pm feeding every Sunday,

00:02:44.962 --> 00:02:47.731
because they know
that there's not a lot of people

00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:49.700
that come out to feed during the week.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.704
They were living at the former
Metro Atlanta Peach Tree

00:02:53.737 --> 00:02:54.939
Homeless Task Force.

00:02:54.972 --> 00:02:59.677
It was the only shelter in the city
that would allow families to come.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.878
And that's so important.

00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.847
A lot of you all don't know,
but if you are a homeless mother,

00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.282
you have a 15-year-old son,

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:07.651
you guys have got to go
to two different shelters.

00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:09.520
And so I was feeding all these people.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.755
I learned about food waste,
and I became upset.

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:13.724
And I was like, I'm going to solve this.

00:03:13.724 --> 00:03:14.992
I'm going to do something,

00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:16.660
to your point, better and “Goodr.”

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.162
And that's what got me started.

00:03:18.162 --> 00:03:19.897
MZ: So explain what Goodr does now,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.400
because from going
to peanut butter sandwiches,

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:24.602
it's impressive.

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:28.038
JCH: So now we have
a two-sided business model

00:03:28.072 --> 00:03:29.473
as it relates to food waste.

00:03:29.473 --> 00:03:32.476
We can help a business keep all
of their food out of landfill.

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.845
If it's edible, we're getting it
to people in need

00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:37.248
that are people like me feeding people:

00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:41.885
shelters, safe houses,
domestic violence centers, churches.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.555
One of our largest partners
is communities and schools.

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.423
We feed thousands of kids every week.

00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:49.593
So we keep edible food
from going to landfill,

00:03:49.627 --> 00:03:52.029
and we are delivering it
directly to people in need

00:03:52.062 --> 00:03:54.465
while giving all of our clients
back a lot of data:

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:56.934
how many pounds they're keeping
out of the landfill,

00:03:56.967 --> 00:04:00.304
what does this mean for their CO2
emissions and their carbon footprint.

00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:02.539
And then we have a hunger side
of our business,

00:04:02.573 --> 00:04:04.408
which was birthed during the pandemic,

00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:07.911
that really focuses on creating
sustainable solutions to solve hunger.

00:04:07.945 --> 00:04:10.848
We build free grocery stores
inside of schools.

00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:13.517
We have 28 right now around the country.

00:04:13.984 --> 00:04:15.753
We have grocery and meal delivery.

00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:17.388
During the height of the pandemic,

00:04:17.388 --> 00:04:20.357
Goodr delivered all the meals
to Atlanta Public School students

00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:23.394
that got free breakfast and lunch
but were learning virtually.

00:04:23.394 --> 00:04:25.629
So we made sure
that they got food at home.

00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:28.332
So we really are solving
hunger and food waste.

00:04:28.332 --> 00:04:29.867
MZ: So can you just explain --

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.101
Can we give her --

00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:35.572
(Applause)

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.775
Part of me is like, 40 percent,

00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:39.943
that's such a crazy statistic.

00:04:39.977 --> 00:04:41.211
JCH: It's a crazy number.

00:04:41.245 --> 00:04:44.081
MZ: Why, when you talk to the companies,

00:04:44.114 --> 00:04:48.352
nonprofits, like, what is happening
that there is so much food available,

00:04:48.385 --> 00:04:49.920
but going nowhere?

00:04:49.953 --> 00:04:51.722
JCH: It's a startling number.

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:54.091
If food waste itself was a country,

00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:56.493
it would be the third-largest
country in the world.

00:04:56.527 --> 00:04:57.661
So it's a lot of food.

00:04:57.695 --> 00:04:58.862
So you think about that.

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:01.665
Between the production,
the transportation and the disposal

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.233
nearly two percent of all US GDP

00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:06.670
we spend on food that,
you know, we never even eat.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.272
And I think what it is is that

00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:10.841
the old guard is, we've always
done it this way.

00:05:10.874 --> 00:05:13.410
We've always thrown it away,
and this is how we do it.

00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:16.714
And of course, when I was first starting,
people were like, oh, well,

00:05:16.747 --> 00:05:18.682
if someone gets sick and we'll get sued.

00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:21.385
And so Goodr said, hey,
we'll take on all of that onus.

00:05:21.418 --> 00:05:24.455
We provide the packaging materials,
we provide the labels.

00:05:24.488 --> 00:05:27.324
When nonprofits receive the food,
it comes from Goodr,

00:05:27.324 --> 00:05:29.059
they sign hold harmless agreements.

00:05:29.093 --> 00:05:31.428
I have a multi-million-dollar
liability insurance

00:05:31.462 --> 00:05:34.932
because the airport was my first customer,
and we were driving on tarmacs,

00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:38.235
and I ended up having to get insurance
that I wasn't quite ready for.

00:05:38.235 --> 00:05:40.070
But it definitely helped the business.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.407
And even with all of that,
people will still say,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.576
"Well, we're just afraid."

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:48.245
Or, “Our lawyers just
can’t wrap their heads around it.”

00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:53.717
Or you know, “We’re going to compost
everything, even if it’s edible.”

00:05:53.717 --> 00:05:56.754
Which I’m still happier
that it’s not going into landfill

00:05:56.787 --> 00:05:57.955
if it gets composted.

00:05:57.988 --> 00:06:00.491
You know, of course, Goodr,
we deliver to hog farms,

00:06:00.491 --> 00:06:02.926
we have anaerobic digesters
we'll take food to.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.795
So we want to keep it out of landfill.

00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:07.498
But feeding hungry people
is not a priority

00:06:07.498 --> 00:06:09.233
for too many people in this country.

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:10.634
And that's a problem.

00:06:10.634 --> 00:06:14.772
(Applause)

00:06:14.772 --> 00:06:18.041
MZ: Tomorrow, I am coming
to see one of your facilities.

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:20.677
JCH: I'm so excited about that,
you're going to love it.

00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:22.946
MZ: From what I understand,
it's bread day,

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:25.916
so bread is going to be coming
in from all different places,

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.885
and then you are going to be sorting it.

00:06:27.885 --> 00:06:29.920
Some of it goes, as you said, to compost,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.555
if it's not for human consumption.

00:06:31.588 --> 00:06:32.756
JCH: Or to a hog farm.

00:06:32.756 --> 00:06:34.725
MZ: Or to a hog farm, which is amazing.

00:06:34.725 --> 00:06:37.428
JCH: Or a cattle farm, I think
we have cattle farms now.

00:06:37.428 --> 00:06:39.196
MZ: Yes you do, I've seen that.

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.666
And then some will go,
of course, to people, to schools,

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.701
to hospitals or wherever else.

00:06:45.068 --> 00:06:50.140
But talk to me more
from the corporate side.

00:06:50.174 --> 00:06:52.543
How did you get people
to come on board with this?

00:06:52.576 --> 00:06:55.479
Did something have to change
when it comes to laws

00:06:55.512 --> 00:06:57.281
and forcing companies to do this?

00:06:57.314 --> 00:07:00.384
Is it because they want to be able
to say to their customers

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:02.553
like, we are a sustainable company.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.023
JCH: So what I used to do
is I would go to the websites

00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:08.459
of the big hotel groups,
the big food groups,

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:10.761
and I would look
at their sustainability reports.

00:07:10.794 --> 00:07:12.863
This is how I got the airport
as a customer.

00:07:12.896 --> 00:07:14.364
And I went to them and I said,

00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:17.801
“Hey, I’m looking at your waste tonnage,

00:07:17.835 --> 00:07:21.271
and 27 percent of this,
according to the EPA, is food.

00:07:21.271 --> 00:07:23.106
So you guys wasted 25 million meals."

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.975
Now I have no idea if that was true,

00:07:24.975 --> 00:07:27.077
but I looked at their
sustainability report.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.479
I used the EPA's calculation

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.714
that food was the number one
thing in landfill,

00:07:30.747 --> 00:07:33.016
and I was able to go back
to the Atlanta airport

00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:35.619
and say, "Listen, you guys
are sitting in College Park,

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:38.689
the children in this city
are living in poverty,

00:07:38.722 --> 00:07:40.624
and all this food is going to waste.

00:07:40.624 --> 00:07:42.259
And this doesn't make any sense."

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:45.362
And so the airport became one
of our first large-scale customers.

00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:47.764
And you think of all
of the grab-and-go food items

00:07:47.798 --> 00:07:50.634
that goes to waste every single night
if it's not for Goodr.

00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:53.003
And now that's why I need
to be in more airports.

00:07:53.003 --> 00:07:55.138
But getting that before it goes to waste

00:07:55.172 --> 00:07:58.208
and getting it to Gateway Center
before Georgia workforce,

00:07:58.242 --> 00:08:01.645
their third shift is coming out
and building half of this city.

00:08:01.678 --> 00:08:04.648
A lot of men that are trying
to transition out of homelessness,

00:08:04.648 --> 00:08:05.849
them getting that meal,

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:07.718
putting this food in our grocery stores

00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:09.553
and families taking it home for free.

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:11.255
This is what it does.

00:08:11.288 --> 00:08:16.260
So I think it was really about making
people keep their promises.

00:08:16.593 --> 00:08:17.828
You know, like, hey,

00:08:17.828 --> 00:08:20.731
I won't say the hotel group,
but they had on their website

00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:22.799
and this is someone
I'm trying to pitch now,

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:26.837
and I was like, you guys said you're going
to cut food waste in half by 2025.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.038
This is in two months.

00:08:28.038 --> 00:08:29.773
Why have you guys not started?

00:08:29.806 --> 00:08:31.241
What’s the process?

00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:34.144
So a lot of times it's trying
to hold their foot to the fire.

00:08:34.177 --> 00:08:35.379
MZ: Can we clone Jasmine?

00:08:35.412 --> 00:08:37.814
I want her holding all these
companies accountable.

00:08:37.814 --> 00:08:38.815
(Applause)

00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:41.652
JCH: It’s about keeping --

00:08:41.685 --> 00:08:45.856
I think we live for the announcement
and we as people don't follow up.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.158
On the delivery, right?

00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:50.694
Because for someone
to invest millions, I mean,

00:08:50.727 --> 00:08:53.430
I don't even know how much
a Super Bowl commercial costs,

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.166
but I've heard it's like
a million dollars per 30 seconds.

00:08:56.199 --> 00:08:57.401
I could be wrong.

00:08:57.401 --> 00:08:59.469
But to invest two to three million dollars

00:08:59.503 --> 00:09:01.138
and not follow up on your promise?

00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:02.673
MZ: That's called greenwashing.

00:09:02.673 --> 00:09:04.441
JCH: Yes, and that's a lot of that.

00:09:04.474 --> 00:09:06.643
MZ: So you're not just
in Atlanta, though now.

00:09:06.643 --> 00:09:07.844
You've grown a lot.

00:09:07.878 --> 00:09:11.081
JCH: Yes, so we are
in 15 states, 26 markets.

00:09:11.582 --> 00:09:15.419
So this is where we have food
moving and being donated.

00:09:15.452 --> 00:09:18.989
And then we have grocery stores
in about five states,

00:09:19.022 --> 00:09:20.557
maybe six or seven now.

00:09:20.591 --> 00:09:24.661
But we are doing our food waste
business obviously in more locations.

00:09:24.695 --> 00:09:25.963
MZ: Someone was asking me,

00:09:25.996 --> 00:09:28.432
they're like, but how do
these companies keep track?

00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:31.401
Because it must be so random
what they can get rid of.

00:09:31.401 --> 00:09:33.837
And I said, well, actually,
there's an app for that.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.406
Which, when I first heard about your app,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.841
I was like, that seems weird,

00:09:37.874 --> 00:09:42.346
but actually it is really the linchpin
in making this new system work.

00:09:42.346 --> 00:09:44.915
JCH: It's a logistics issue,
that's really what I saw.

00:09:44.915 --> 00:09:50.087
So when and shout out to Jackie Chu,
she runs TEDxAtlanta,

00:09:50.087 --> 00:09:53.490
and she convinced me
to do my first TEDx Talk.

00:09:53.523 --> 00:09:56.026
And when I was talking to her
about it, she was like,

00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:58.028
"Oh, I get it, it's a logistics problem."

00:09:58.061 --> 00:09:59.363
And I was like, you get it.

00:09:59.363 --> 00:10:00.797
And that's really what it is.

00:10:00.797 --> 00:10:02.532
Hunger is not an issue of scarcity.

00:10:02.532 --> 00:10:03.967
And we hear about that, right?

00:10:04.001 --> 00:10:06.637
We need to produce more food,
we need to grow more food

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.271
We are wasting 40 percent of it.

00:10:08.271 --> 00:10:09.640
It's really about logistics.

00:10:09.673 --> 00:10:13.276
How do we connect this excess food
with the millions of people that need it?

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.145
Seniors, their income doesn't change.

00:10:15.178 --> 00:10:17.014
We're going to be seniors, all of us.

00:10:17.014 --> 00:10:18.582
Some of us probably already are.

00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:20.117
But all of us, God willing.

00:10:20.117 --> 00:10:21.652
And once you get to that point,

00:10:21.685 --> 00:10:23.887
it doesn't matter then
if toilet paper goes up,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.056
if bread or eggs are more expensive.

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:27.724
This is all you have to work with.

00:10:27.758 --> 00:10:30.327
So it's really about how
quickly can we match it.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.663
So we inventory everything
it is that they sell.

00:10:32.663 --> 00:10:36.033
We create a very easy user experience
where they click on the items,

00:10:36.066 --> 00:10:38.402
tell us how many, request the pick-up.

00:10:38.435 --> 00:10:41.672
We leverage the shared economy
that's already out there,

00:10:41.705 --> 00:10:45.042
and that's how we've been able
to grow to a lot of different locations.

00:10:45.075 --> 00:10:46.943
We don't have to hire our own drivers

00:10:46.977 --> 00:10:49.112
or purchase trucks and vehicles.

00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:50.380
Now we do have a couple,

00:10:50.414 --> 00:10:53.550
but what we leverage is a driver
that's already out there.

00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:54.751
And drivers love it.

00:10:54.785 --> 00:10:57.120
They're like, "Oh my God,
I'm feeding people,

00:10:57.154 --> 00:10:58.855
I'm getting paid to do it."

00:10:58.855 --> 00:11:00.190
And they make it happen.

00:11:00.223 --> 00:11:01.958
MZ: So, literally, like, the person,

00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.327
let's say I'm working
at a big company and I work,

00:11:04.361 --> 00:11:06.863
you know, in the cafeteria area,

00:11:06.897 --> 00:11:08.932
I take out my phone, and what do I do?

00:11:08.932 --> 00:11:11.234
JCH: Or it could go on
your point of sale system

00:11:11.268 --> 00:11:12.769
and you click on the Goodr app,

00:11:12.803 --> 00:11:14.438
your menu is already there,

00:11:14.438 --> 00:11:16.873
and you're just clicking
on the items that you have,

00:11:16.907 --> 00:11:19.476
saying, I’ve got 10 chicken
breasts, I’ve got this.

00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:22.646
Our platform is calculating
the approximate weight of those items.

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:25.315
So we pull a lot of that data
from US Foods, Sysco,

00:11:25.348 --> 00:11:27.317
whoever they're ordering their food from,

00:11:27.317 --> 00:11:30.220
and then it's calculating
the tax value of those items

00:11:30.253 --> 00:11:31.421
at the time of donation,

00:11:31.421 --> 00:11:33.724
which is a critical offering
to our clients.

00:11:33.724 --> 00:11:37.160
And once that food gets picked up,
a nonprofit receives it.

00:11:37.194 --> 00:11:40.030
They sign for it like
they would a UPS package,

00:11:40.063 --> 00:11:42.833
and a donation letter
with a picture of that donation

00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:44.334
from that nonprofit

00:11:44.367 --> 00:11:46.436
automatically goes to our client's portal.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.772
So now they see everything
that they've donated,

00:11:48.805 --> 00:11:50.140
the nonprofit it went to,

00:11:50.173 --> 00:11:52.876
and a tax deduction receipt
for what they donated.

00:11:52.909 --> 00:11:56.146
(Applause)

00:11:56.179 --> 00:11:58.014
MZ: And the carbon that they've saved?

00:11:58.048 --> 00:12:01.384
JCH: Yeah, we have a corporate social
responsibility impact report

00:12:01.418 --> 00:12:03.553
as well as a sustainability.

00:12:03.587 --> 00:12:07.290
And actually, I remember
one of my angel investors,

00:12:07.324 --> 00:12:10.193
she sits on the board of IHG,
who’s one of Goodr’s customers,

00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:13.196
and she messaged me last year
at their board meeting in London.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.532
And she was like,
"Goodr is on the board report."

00:12:15.532 --> 00:12:18.769
They’re literally talking
about how we’re cutting food waste

00:12:18.802 --> 00:12:19.936
with this company.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.272
MZ: So they're starting
to show off by using you.

00:12:22.305 --> 00:12:23.940
JCH: As they should.

00:12:23.974 --> 00:12:25.542
(Laughter)

00:12:25.575 --> 00:12:27.544
It's such a good thing, yeah.

00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:29.346
MZ: Growth.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.314
I mean, we should be clear,

00:12:31.348 --> 00:12:32.516
you're not a nonprofit.

00:12:32.549 --> 00:12:34.050
You are a B Corp.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.052
Why is that important to you?

00:12:36.086 --> 00:12:39.122
Why did you decide to go
for a for-profit company?

00:12:39.156 --> 00:12:42.826
Is it because that is something
that you hope to scale?

00:12:42.826 --> 00:12:44.661
Where are the pros and cons with that?

00:12:44.694 --> 00:12:46.196
JCH: There was a couple things.

00:12:46.196 --> 00:12:49.900
One, I think the nonprofit was going to be
a much harder old guard to get past

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.235
because everybody always donates
to the food bank.

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:56.006
It's all we ever know, we've been doing
canned food drives since we were eight.

00:12:56.039 --> 00:12:58.041
Our kids are still doing it in school now,

00:12:58.074 --> 00:13:00.710
and I felt like I was going to be
spending a lot of time

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.879
trying to gain respect
in the nonprofit space.

00:13:02.913 --> 00:13:04.681
The biggest piece that I saw, though,

00:13:04.714 --> 00:13:08.218
was that businesses were already
paying to throw this food away.

00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:09.753
So this was not newfound spin.

00:13:09.786 --> 00:13:12.556
They're already paying
Waste Management, Republic Services,

00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:14.090
whoever their waste company is.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.860
Mind you, the waste industry
is a trillion-dollar industry.

00:13:16.893 --> 00:13:20.030
None of us ever say,
let's just keep our trash.

00:13:20.063 --> 00:13:22.265
We were like, is trash day missing?

00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:24.701
Oh my God, it's a hurricane,
they didn't run today.

00:13:24.701 --> 00:13:27.337
We are paying for this on a daily basis.

00:13:27.337 --> 00:13:28.905
So when I realized that,

00:13:28.939 --> 00:13:32.542
I realized that this was not going to be
newfound spin for these businesses.

00:13:32.576 --> 00:13:34.311
It was going to be a better spin.

00:13:34.344 --> 00:13:36.980
So dollar for dollar,
we're a little bit more expensive.

00:13:37.013 --> 00:13:39.916
But the outcome, the return
on the investment for our clients

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.018
is far much greater
than they would ever get

00:13:42.018 --> 00:13:43.620
from a traditional waste company.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.856
And so I do look at us
as a triple bottom line,

00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:48.592
we're for people, we're for planet
and we are for profit.

00:13:48.592 --> 00:13:51.561
(Applause and cheers)
